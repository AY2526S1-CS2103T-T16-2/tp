**TAHub is a desktop application** designed to help NUS Computer Science **Teaching Assistant (TAs)** to manage small tutorial groups with many students. While it comes with a GUI, most of the interactions are carried out using a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
* If you are interested in using TAHub, head over to the [Quick Start section in **User Guide**](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-t16-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TAHub, the **[Developer Guide](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-t16-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)** is a good place to start.
